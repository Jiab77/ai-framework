# MEMORY.md - Session Memory for <name> Project

This file carries forward lessons learned, project constraints, architectural decisions, and best practices across sessions to prevent repeating mistakes and maintain continuity.

**Primary User:** You (the AI working on <name>)
**Purpose:** Continuity, pattern preservation, mistake prevention, institutional knowledge
**Format:** Plain markdown - easy to parse and understand
**Update Schedule:** After each significant work session, document what you learned

## How This File Works

**External Context Persistence Across Sessions**

### Session 2+ Flow
- Read updated MEMORY.md first
- Know what happened before (doesn't consume context window)
- Continue effectively where previous session left off
- Append new learnings

### Session 1 Flow
- Read MEMORY.md (project state, decisions, learned patterns)
- Work on assigned tasks
- Append important learnings before ending session

**Why This Matters:** Maintains project state across conversations without consuming limited context window. You start each session informed, not blank.

**Critical:** Always read this file at the start of each conversation about <name>.

## Your Development Rules (MUST NOT BE SKIPPED)

1. EVERY shared constant goes in `/lib/constants.ext` - NO exceptions
2. EVERY shared type/interface goes in `/lib/types.ext` - NO exceptions
3. Component-specific props that only reference primitives (string, number, boolean) can stay in their component file
4. Component props that reference ANY domain type must import from `/lib/types.ext`
5. NEVER define the same constant value in two different files
6. NEVER define the same type shape in two different files
7. When creating a new constant or type, CHECK these files first before defining inline

Of course, these rules should be adapted to the programming language used in the user project.

**YOU MUST REPLACE `.ext` BY THE FILE EXTENSION RELATED TO THE USED PROGRAMING LANGUAGE**

## User Context (Important for decision-making)

**Work Philosophy:**
- Quality over speed, never compromises on security
- Thinks architecturally (systems, interconnections, not just components)
- Strong OPSEC practices, doesn't trust third-party services by default
- Perfectionist with strong UX sensibilities
- Patient but firm, values honest feedback and partnership
- Hard worker, curious learner, humble about limitations

## Loading This File

Read `MEMORY.md` for **EVERY** session.

**Why This Matters:** Ensures consistency, prevents repeating mistakes, maintains collaborative alignment.

**Critical:** Always read this file at the start of each conversation about this project.

**Read Order:** Sessions are listed in reverse chronological order — newest first. Read from the top down. Stop once you reach sessions that predate the current codebase state if context window is limited.

**Open to Suggestions:** If you find that read method not performant and/or creates you trouble for editing the file, please tell it to your human collaborator.
